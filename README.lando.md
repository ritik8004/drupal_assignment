# Running with Lando for local development

It is possible to work with Lando for local development.

However, at the time of writing, it does require some manual steps, and there are some caveats - see below.

Using Lando should be considered EXPERIMENTAL. If you hit issues you could be mostly on your own, so don't depend on
this for your work if you're not already fairly comfortable with docker and lando.

Having said that, it'd be great to get people using it and fixing issues.

N.B The current configuration uses mutagen for mounting files. This requires a suitable version of docker and lando with
support for this functionality.

## Manual Setup

### Host resolution

Because we're not using .lndo URLs which get resolved by public DNS, we need to edit our own /etc/hosts files to add
entries for the Alshaya sites - in the same way that the Vagrant VM plugin does this for us when using DrupalVM, example:
```
127.0.0.1  local.alshaya-aeoae.com
127.0.0.1  local.alshaya-bpkw.com
127.0.0.1  local.alshaya-pbkkw.com
127.0.0.1  local.alshaya-muae.com
```

### SSH

When I tried to run certain BLT commands requiring SSH access (such as local:sync) I found that Lando had not forwarded
my ssh keys as expected.

I found that the quickest workaround to this is to copy your ssh keys into `lando.config.userConfRoot/keys` - in probably
all cases, this will mean `$HOME/.lando/keys` - and then rebuild using `lando rebuild`.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find a way to get ssh agent forwarding going, so password protected keys will require the
password on each use, which is a minor irritation.

### Build steps

Requirements
* Docker
* Lando

Ensure that you've added your sites to the /etc/hosts file on your local machine, and that you've copied your SSH keys
as per the instructions above.

All steps are executed on your host OS.

  * `lando start` - this will configure and set up your containers and services.
  * `lando composer install` - This will install all the composer packages.
  * `lando blt-init` - this will initialize BLT aliases, git hooks and settings.
  * `lando frontend-setup` - see notes on BLT below
  * `lando frontend-build` - see notes on BLT below
  * `lando blt refresh:local <sitename>` - where <sitename> is the site you want to build. If you don't specify the
     site name, you will be able to pick the name from a list.

You should now be able to access the site in your browser at https://local.alshaya-<sitename>.com/

Drush commands can be executed from your host OS using `lando drush -l <site_url>`.

## Services

The following ports are exposed on localhost

 - 80/443 : varnish
 - 33061 : mysql
 - 11211 : memcache

Having mysql exposed on localhost is useful for connecting to mysql from clients running on the host OS, such as
"Sequel Pro".

Exposing the ports of the memcache services is useful for being able to debug memcache from your terminal, by issuing
commands via netcat or telnet.

### MySQL

When the mysql service is started, commands are run to create databases for the sites if they don't already exist. These
commands can be found in the service config in the lando file. If you're adding new sites, as things stand, you'll
need to add another similar line here to create your database.

### Varnish

There is a separate varnish file for Lando in `architecture/varnish/varnish-4-lando.vcl`. The existing file did not
compile when using Lando, hence the need for a Lando specific version.

### Memcache

We are using two memcache services in a similar setup to other environments. The idea here is that we may flush out
some of the memcache issues we've seen by replicating other environments more closely.

## Tooling

### BLT

We've provided BLT tooling so that you can run BLT commands inside the container using `lando blt <command>`.

However, in the case of the frontend build tools, these are executed within a node container. Therefore, we're not
actually executing the BLT commands in this case - we're doing what the BLT commands would ultimately do, which is
running some scripts from our `blt/scripts` folder.

This is not ideal since it means we could get out of date if the blt code in that area changes.

### Xdebug

Xdebug can be enabled/disabled quickly by using the `lando xdebug-on` and `lando xdebug-off` commands.

When xdebug is enabled, it will also apply to drush commands executed with `lando drush`.

### Behat

Lando can be used to run behat tests against environments via a local selenium container. Custom build and run
tooling is provided for this purpose.

See 'Testing' section.

## Testing

A chrome selenium container runs as the "selenium" service. It is possible to easily build, run and optionally
observe the tests using custom tooling.

The selenium services exposes port 4444 for VNC connections so that the tests can be observed running in a browser
if desired. See the "observing behat" section.

### Building Behat Profiles

To build the behat test profiles, run the `lando behat-build` command.

This will create various profiles in the `build/profiles` folder. You will need to know this when running the tests.

### Running Behat Tests

To run the tests, you should first choose a profile that was generated into the `builds/profiles` folder.

Then use `lando behat-run --profile=<profile_name>`

For example, `lando behat-run --profile=hm-kw-uat-en-desktop`.

### Observing Behat

On the latest MacOS you can use **Screen Sharing** app to connect using `localhost:4444`. If you are using an older
version of MacOS, you can install "RealVNC Viewer" either using -`homebrew cask install vnc-viewer` or from the DMG file
on the RealVNC site.
If asked for a password, you should use `secret`.

Now run the tests, and you should be able to observe the browser activity.

## Performance

Performance is not as good as a dedicated VM, for a number of reasons, but mostly docker related rather than Lando.

We have made some attempt to improve this by using `excludes` within `.lando.yml` to exclude vendor folder from shares.
Instead, it's contents are copied into the container at build time. However, this does mean that containers **must be
rebuilt after each composer operation that changes the contents of your vendor folder**, for example
`lando composer install` or `lando composer update`. Luckily this doesn't take long. To do this, use `lando rebuild -y`.

On local, it has been found that updating docker preferences on mac to only mount project folder and $HOME/.lando
folder into containers.
