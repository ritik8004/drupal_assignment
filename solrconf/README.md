This folder contains overrides for Apache Solr search.

This mainly adds support for Arabic text. Many of these files have been generated by the `search_api_solr_multilingual` module. The stopwords and synonyms have been customized for Alshaya.

The stopwords have been split into English and Arabic. The Arabic stopwords have been combined with those provided by Solr.

The synonyms have been split into English and Arabic synonym files.

Arabic protected words (`protwords`) have not been added at this time.

The `schema_extra_types.xml` defines a text field type for English and Arabic.

The `schema_extra_fields.xml` defines an extra dynamic field for English and Arabic text.

Note: The `search_api_solr_multilingual` module defined an undefined text field type (`text_und`) which was duplicated by the default field type. That has been manually removed.
