## Onboarding

### Development workflow

There are 2 git repositories on the project:
* Github: used for local development, contains much more than what is needed
  to run the sites.
* Acquia Cloud: used on Acquia environments only, contains the strict minimum
  to run the sites.

The synchronisation between the 2 repositories is ensured by blt.
Cf. `blt deploy`.

#### Back merges

Any code merged into upstream branch is automatically back-merged.

* There is Heroku APP running to do this
* Back merges are done from master => uat => qa => develop => develop-*

### Local git repository

Each developer uses a fork of the main repository for their developments and
creates Pull Requests (PRs) against the main repository when he is ready.

To prepare your local env:
* Fork the main repository into your own repository, i.e. click on Fork button
  on https://github.com/acquia-pso/alshaya page.
* Clone the fork locally: `git clone git@github.com:<your_username>/alshaya.git`
* Add a git remote for the main repository (aka upstream):
  * `cd alshaya`
  * `git remote add upstream git@github.com:acquia-pso/alshaya.git`
  * `git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLED`

From now on, you will fetch/pull from upstream remote to get the changes that
have been merged into the main repository and push to origin remote to save
changes and create PRs.

### Local dev environment

The team uses Drupal VM. It provides a vagrant box that has been customized to
fit the needs of the project.
The principle is that the configuration of the VM is stored in the git
repository so that each developer uses the same configuration which is as close
as possible to the configuration of the Prod env.
You typically run all the drush and blt commands *from inside* of the VM.

_**Note**: We also have a **lando** setup available. As time has gone by more and more dependencies have prevented us from moving
to newer drupal-vm versions, this has meant you might face issues on newer Mac OS Big Sur or on Catalina with certain
vagrant and virtualbox variants. It is recommended to use the lando setup for such cases. Check [README.lando.md](README.lando.md)._

To prepare your local env:
* Install Virtualbox and Vagrant.
  * `vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest`
  * `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater`
* Install Yarn `npm i -g yarn`.
* Install Ansible: `pip3 install ansible-base ansible`
* Run:
  * From outside VM:
    * `composer clear-cache`
    * `composer install --ignore-platform-reqs -n`
    * `composer blt-alias`
    * `vagrant up`
    * `vagrant ssh` to ssh into your vm
      Note: Before running any below commands in your VM. Please check your composer version that's need to be
      same as of your local machine. (Run `composer -v` both inside and outside).
      If any case composer version of your local machine and VM is not matching then downgrade or upgrade the version as per your requirement. Then run : `composer self-update --1` (i.e 1.10.10)

  * From inside VM:
    * `composer build-middlewares`
    * `blt blt:init:git-hooks`
    * `blt blt:init:settings`
    * `blt frontend:setup`
    * `blt frontend:build`
    * `blt refresh:local` (from inside of your vm)
    * Enter the site code you want to setup the site for (this can be avoided by adding the site code in blt params like `blt refresh:local mckw`)
    * Perform drush commands from inside of your vm, like `drush status -l local.alshaya-mckw.com`
    * Login quickly using `drush uli -l local.alshaya-mckw.com`  (note: currently doesn't work properly)

* Access the site in your web browser, e.g. http://local.alshaya-mckw.com/en/user
* Login using the default credentials: no-reply@acquia.com / admin

# For Varnish:
* Access site through Varnish in local
* Comment out the code forcing SSL redirection in `docroot/.htaccess`
* Access the site on port 81
* To do any changes in VCL do it in `conf/varnish-4.vcl`, Run `vagrant ssh` and  then run `sh box/scripts/configure-varnish.sh`.

Check for known issues during setup check here: https://alshayagroup.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ACSF/pages/589004885/Developer+Handbook#DeveloperHandbook-LocalWorkarounds

Next builds can be done using: `blt refresh:local:drupal`
Behat tests can be run using: `vagrant ssh --command='cd /var/www/alshaya ; blt tests:behat'`

### React Modules.

#### Build React files for local.
if someone wants to just rebuild the files to use in local `blt react-build` can be used.
For

#### React module development.
Go through the [README file](./docroot/modules/react/README.md) to start with react module development.

### Alshaya SPC Middleware development.
We have a sub-application symfony based to handle all the API calls.
Go through the [README file](./docroot/middleware/README.md) to start with SPC middleware development.

### Running behat tests with headless Chrome locally on MacOS
This reproduces the travis behavior closely (travis is running selected tests from alshaya_behat folder on daily basis), so use this way if your tests behave differently from travis.
You **do not** need Java/Selenium/BLT/drupalvm installed for this.

* Make sure you have Google Chrome browser installed on your host PC
* Navigate to your repo root (you will run all commands below from repo root of host PC)
* Make alias to your chrome browser, e.g. `alias chrome="/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome"`
* Run `chrome --headless --remote-debugging-port=9222 --window-size=1920,1080 http://localhost`
* Open new terminal window
* Run `vendor/bin/behat  --format pretty alshaya_behat/features/hmkw/common/sign_in.feature --colors --no-interaction --stop-on-failure --strict --config tests/behat/integration.yml --profile hmkw-uat -v`

Notes:
* Replace the "sign_in.feature" with other features or folder to run different tests
* Replace "hmkw-uat" profile with other profiles, see `tests/behat/integration.yml` file for more examples.
* While headless chrome is running, you can visit http://localhost:9222 to see how the "screen" of the tests looks like.
* You can also see the screenshots of failed tests in `tests/behat/reports` folder

### Troubleshooting

* `blt refresh:local` failed in drupal installation with EntityStorageException (...) entity with ID '...' already exists
  * The reason for this is in the existing configuration values that still exist in memcache. The workaround is that you either restart the vm using ​vagrant reload​ command, or you restart memcache service using sudo service memcached restart in your vm and restart `blt refresh:local` again
* In case, updates done to default settings.php don't reflect in sites/g/settings/local.settigns.php:
  * `rm -rf docroot/sites/g/settings/local.settings.php` to make sure refresh local or local reset settings updates the file with new settings.
  * `blt local:reset-settings-file` to reset local settings file.

### Create a new site

Currently, 2 distinct installation profiles exist in the code base. `transac`
installation profile will enable all the modules required for an a site with
commercial features and integration with Conductor/Magento. `non_transac`
profile is a light/static site without any commercial feature.`

* Create a custom module in `docroot/modules/brands`. This module's goal is to
  enable the appropriate theme, place the blocks in the theme's regions and
  install the specific configuration. See existing brand modules for example.
* Install the new theme for the respective brand inside this brand module.
* See "Create a new theme for the site." for specific instructions on creating a new theme.
* Add a new brand support:
  * Add DB and Alias in `box/config.yml`
  * Add site in `blt/alshaya_local_sites.yml` with proper values (check existing sites for example)
  * Add drush aliases to the site into `drush/sites` folder with proper values (check existing sites for example)
  * (For transact site) Add proper settings for the new site in
    * factory-hooks/environments/magento.php
    * factory-hooks/environments/settings.php
    * factory-hooks/environments/conductor.php
* `vagrant reload --provision`
* Run `blt refresh:local` commands and enter appropriate site code when asked.

### Create a new theme for the site.

#### Overview.
* There are three three different theme types, transac theme, non transac theme and amp theme.
* You will find this under `themes/custom/transac`, `themes/custom/non_transac` and `themes/custom/amp`.
* We heavily rely on theme inheritance, so each theme type has a alshaya specific base theme to spped up the theme creation process.
* Transac theme is for trnasactional sites, and `alshaya_white_label` is used as a base theme by default for transac installation profile.
* Non-Transac theme is for non transactional sites, which are usually a placeholder sites until the transactional sites are launched. `whitelabel` is used as a base theme by default for non transac installation profile.
* AMP themes use "Accelerated Mobile Pages" specifications for certain pages on the site, AMP theme is by default enabled for all profiles. `alshaya_amp_white_label` is the base AMP theme.
* Also see `docroot/themes/custom/README.md` for some additional steps related to CI applicable to all themes.

#### Transac theme.
* `alshaya_example_subtheme` is designed as a copy paste starter kit for new brands.
* Check `docroot/themes/custom/transac/alshaya_example_subtheme/README.md` for steps to create a new transac theme.
* Use standard Drupal practices to override anything that is coming from base theme.
* Use any of the existing brand themes as an example for reference.

#### Non Transac theme.
* Duplicate any of the brand themes inside `non_transac` directory.
* Change the info file, directory name and hook names in approprite files.
* Non transac themes use patternlab with all the components inherited from base theme.
* Remove any scss files inside sass directory from the duplicated themed.
* You should have a clean non transac theme with all styles inherited from base theme.
* Override what is necessary.

#### AMP theme.
* AMP as a spec provides limited customization.
* If any custom work is needed for a brand on AMP pages, copy paste any of the brand amp themes.
* Change the name of the theme in appropriate files.
* Override what is necessary, follow other brand AMP themes as reference.

### Update local site from cloud.
Script is created to download db from cloud env and configure local env
with that. We also enable stage_file_proxy to ensure files are available
in local as and when required. All required changes are done.
* Configure stage_file_proxy
* Update super admin user
* Enable dblog and other ui modules
* Allows hooking into the script, we can create scripts/install-site-dev.sh
  which is already added to .gitignore and add any code we want to execute post
  this script (for instance command to shout loud in mac - `say installation
  done`). One argument - site code will be passed to this script.

Script usage:
* `blt local:sync "site" "env" "mode"`
* `blt local:sync mckw dev reuse`
* `blt local:sync hmkw2 uat reuse`
* `blt local:sync vsae3 dev2 download`
* `blt local:download "site" "env"`

Be careful in using the mode download, it will take time as it does sql-dump
using drush which can take too much of time.

You also need to forward your private key to your vm, because all the commands
above need to be run from inside of vm and they reach remote cloud instance.

In order to perform the private key forwarding, do following:

* Edit ​`~/.ssh/config` ​file on your host machine and add following two lines:
  * Host 127.0.0.1
  * ForwardAgent yes
* `​ssh-add ~/.ssh/your_private_key​` (this adds your key to the ssh agent, the path to your private key your connecting to Acquia Cloud with - by default ​~/.ssh/id_rsa​)
* `​ssh-add -L`​ (ensure your private key is listed between the keys displayed on ssh agent) 4. ​vagrant ssh​ (connects to you guest machine)

### Drush aliases

* On your local environment, from inside of the vm, use either `drush -l local.alshaya-<site>.com` or `drush @<site>.local` alias to reach the site. Example: `drush @mckw.local status`
* Acquia cloud sites are reachable from inside of vm (assuming your private key is properly forwarded, see previous paragraph) with `drush @<site>.01<env>` format. For example: `drush @hmkw.01dev3 status` will display status of hmkw site on dev3 environment.
* On Acquia Cloud, the sites are only reachable via drush without the alias from inside of the environment you are in (cross-environment connections are not supported via drush, however a direct ssh/scp connection can be used if needed). Therefore we are not using drush aliases in that case and use format `drush -l <site>.<env>-alshaya.acsitefactory.com` from the application's `docroot` folder to reach that site.

### Optional: Running drush aliases from your host PC

As mentioned above, you should typically run all the blt and drush commands (except the initial one `blt vm` that initializes your virtual machine) from inside of your vm. This should cover all the typical cases and you can skip this part if you are fully comfortable with that approach. However, for the better convenience, it is sometimes quicker to run some drush commands from host PC. For example, running drush uli from host logs quickly user 1 into the site without need of copy/pasting of login link. PC To make this working follow these steps:

* Install [Drush launcher](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush-launcher) on your host PC (archive old drush8 command somewhere if you want to run it for another projects)
* To connect to vagrant instances from host pc, use @<site>.vm aliases, e.g. `drush @hmkw.vm status`. These aliases cannot be used to sync databases to local (see Technical details on aliases structure for more information)
* To connect to remote sites, use standard `drush @<site>.01<env>` form, e.g. `drush @hmkw.01dev3 status`. Note this will only work if the remote site has already deployed blt9 and drush9 (see next topic)

### Technical details on drush 9 aliases structure

In Drush 9, we strictly need to differentiate between “local” and “remote” aliases when running some commands (e.g. `drush sql-sync`, `drush browse` etc.), “Local” aliases are identified by “host” and “user” settings in their corresponding *.yml files: these fields must be empty for local aliases and only these aliases can be used e.g. to sync data from cloud environments (drush sql-sync does not support sync between two remote aliases - yet).

Local aliases are the aliases with *.local suffix on Alshaya: e.g. [site].local - they are intended to by only used from inside of vm and are suitable for most common development operations, including sql-sync. On Alshaya though, we must specify "127.0.0.1" as a host for local aliases for now. It supports some local drush commands, but it's not entirely correct and prevents currently proper `drush sql-sync` functionality on these aliases. The target is to fix it so the host setting should be empty, but without that setting it currently doesn't match the particular local sites properly now. The Jira ticket CORE-5994 was created to fix that.

Remote aliases are divided into two groups:
* Acquia cloud aliases in form `[site].01[env]`
* Drupal vm aliases in form of `[site].vm` that can be used to reach vm from host PC, but are not usable for any remote sync operations

All site aliases are defined in `drush/sites` folder.

### Local setup of Behat:
* Start Behat installation on your local by following the steps below:
  * Create a directory, say 'alshaya_behat' [if not exist]
  -  * Clone alshaya git repo
  -  * cd alshaya_behat
  -  * composer install
  -  * npm install --prefix bin chromedriver

### Behat execution Process

### Prerequisites for behat.yml before running the scripts
* Ensure the base url is correct for the profile you are using.
* Ensure the config product url is valid and is in stock.

Scripts location:
QA/UAT: sitename/common folder has all scripts that can be executed on QA/UAT envs.
Production: Scripts starting from Sanity_** are the only ones that should be executed on production.

Execution:

* Navigate to alshaya_behat folder in terminal window
* Initialise selenium by executing below command
* (In a separate terminal window) java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=bin/node_modules/chromedriver/bin/chromedriver -jar vendor/se/selenium-server-standalone/bin/selenium-server-standalone.jar
* (In a separate terminal window) navigate to alshaya_behat folder
* bin/behat features/mothercare/common/checkout.feature --profile=mcuat
* The above command will run the checkout.feature script for MC and the profile used should be according to environment.
* Another way to run: Use tags e.g
  bin/behat --@tagname --profile=mcuat



### How to interpret the Behat reports:
* When the execution of the feature file is completed, navigate to site folder directory which is inside your parent directory. e.g (hmkw)
* Open html->behat->index.html. This has your test execution details for the last run only. This gets overwritten with new execution.
* In order to share the reports, compress the html directory immediately after every run.

### Test Results analysis:
* If any scenarios fail, try re-running the script once to discard any network issues.
* If they still fail, check the scenarios if they are failing due to data issue (some text assertions changed on the site)
* Check by running the scenario manually if it passes
* Check by running the scenario individually to see if it passes (use tags)

### Debugging with xdebug

A recommended IDE for debugging is PhpStorm. However, if you use another IDE, you should be able to apply the guidelines below with some tweaks.

> *NOTE: XDEBUG Port configured in VM is 9002*

#### Browser-based debugging

XDebug debugger is enabled by default. In order to debug your code from browser, do following:
* In Google Chrome browser, install “Xdebug helper” extension
* In PhpStorm, select from menu “Run/Start listening for PHP debug connections”
* Set breakpoint somewhere in the code
* Refresh the page
* Debugger should stop at the breakpoint you set

#### CLI Debugging

**CLI debugging is disabled by default.** The reason is significant performance degradation of all php scripts (incl. composer, drush, blt...) inside of vm when xdebug is enabled. However, CLI debugging is important, especially for debugging behat tests or unit tests. To enable CLI debugging, do following:

* Make sure you firstly invoked debugger from browser at least once.
* In File/Preferences of phpStorm, section Languages & Frameworks / PHP / Servers, write down server name the debugger invoked in previous step (e.g. "local.alshaya-mckw.com")
* Change variable php_xdebug_cli_disable to "no" in box/config.yml and run vagrant provision.
* wait until machine is successfully re-provisioned
* make sure your PhpStorm is listening to php debug connections
* vagrant ssh to your guest
* cd /var/www/alshaya/docroot (your document root on guest)
* Prefix PHP_IDE_CONFIG="serverName=<server_name>" XDEBUG_CONFIG="remote_host=10.0.2.2" before the command you wish to debug e.g.:

PHP_IDE_CONFIG="serverName=local.alshaya-mckw.com" XDEBUG_CONFIG="remote_host=10.0.2.2" vendor/drush/drush/drush -l local.alshaya-mckw.com status

Specific notes for debugging drush commands:
* Use full path to drush in vendor folder (vendor/drush/drush/drush) instead of drush command itself (it runs launcher which is typically outside of codebase)
* You will eventually need to fix path mappings for the commands like drush and point them to your Alshaya codebase in vendor folder
* Do NOT use drush aliases like @mckw.local for debugging, use always the -l parameter instead (see above for a valid example)

After finishing CLI debuging it's recommended to disable xdebug back again, to increase performance. To debug CLI commands like Drush, Drupal console or PhpUnit, follow these steps:

### Remote debugging from ACSF
On ACSF dev, dev2 and dev3 environments, xdebug is enabled for remote debugging.
Follow instructions [here](https://support.acquia.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006231933-How-to-debug-an-Acquia-Cloud-environment-using-PhpStorm-and-Remote-Xdebug) to set up remote debugging on your local PhpStorm to leverage it.

### XHPROF in local
#### Setup
Download and add [xhprof](https://www.drupal.org/project/xhprof) in docroot/modules/development

#### Usage
* Enable the module (if not enabled already)
* Add profile=1 in query string to any URL which you want to profile
* Check [factory-hooks/post-settings-php/xhprof.php](factory-hooks/post-settings-php/xhprof.php) for more details on default configuration

### Enable Apple-Pay on local.
* Setup Apple pay wallet (https://alshayagroup.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ACSF/pages/577208482/Apple+Pay+-+Setup)
* Download / Copy SSL (merchant_id.key and merchant_id.pem files) from Cloud dev/test environment of any brand and place them in local environment folder as per paths (usually /var/www/apple-pay-resources) defined in factory-hooks/pre-settings-php/apple_pay.php
* The Apple-Pay payment method appears on desktop view if "apple_pay_allowed_in" key from configuration acq_checkoutcom.settings is set to 'all'
  Drush command to set config to all: drush -l <site-url> cset acq_checkoutcom.settings apple_pay_allowed_in 'all' --input-format=yaml

### Finding deprecated code (using drupal-check)
* Command format: drupal-check [OPTIONS] [DIRS]

* Options:
    -a Check analysis
    -d Check deprecations (default)
    -e Exclude directories. Wildcards work. Separate multiple excluded directories with commas, no spaces. e.g.: */tests/codeception/acceptance/*.php
    --drupal-root Path to Drupal root. Fallback option if drupal-check could not identify Drupal root from the provided path(s).

* Deprecations.
  - vendor/mglaman/drupal-check/drupal-check -d docroot/modules/custom
* Analysis.
  - vendor/mglaman/drupal-check/drupal-check -a docroot/modules/custom

### General Notes
#### Issue with accesing cloud urls from Linux Systems
There is an issue observered when trying to access dev/uat etc website urls from linux systems.
The issue happens because CloudFlare blocks the request and we see the message `Site can't be reached` in the browser.
In such a situation, we need to add the following  mapping to the `/etc/hosts` file in the local system and then access the website again (the IP address can be the same for all the domains)
```
104.16.65.106	hmkw5-pprod.factory.alshaya.com
104.16.65.106	weae2-test.factory.alshaya.com
```
