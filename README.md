## Onboarding

### Development workflow

There are 2 git repositories on the project:
* Github: used for local development, contains much more than what is needed
to run the sites.
* Acquia Cloud: used on Acquia environments only, contains the strict minimum
to run the sites.

The synchronisation between the 2 repositories is ensured by blt.
Cf. `blt deploy`.

### Local git repository

Each developer uses a fork of the main repository for his developments and
creates Pull Requests (PRs) against the main repository when he is ready.

To prepare your local env:
* Fork the main repository into your own repository, i.e. click on Fork button
on https://github.com/acquia-pso/alshaya page.
* Clone the fork locally: `git clone git@github.com:<your_username>/alshaya.git`
* Add a git remote for the main repository (aka upstream):
  * `cd alshaya`
  * `git remote add upstream git@github.com:acquia-pso/alshaya.git`
  * `git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLED`

From now on, you will fetch/pull from upstream remote to get the changes that
have been merged into the main repository and push to origin remote to save
changes and create PRs.

### Local dev environment

The team uses Drupal VM. It provides a vagrant box that has been customized to
fit the needs of the project.
The principle is that the configuration of the VM is stored in the git
repository so that each developer uses the same configuration which is as close
as possible to the configuration of the Prod env.
You typically run all the the drush and blt commands *from inside* of the VM.

To prepare your local env:
* Install Virtualbox and Vagrant.
  * `vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest`
  * `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater`
* Install Yarn `npm i -g yarn`.
* Install Ansible: `brew install ansible`
* Run:
  * `composer clear-cache`
  * `composer install`
  * `composer blt-alias`
  * `blt vm`
  * `vagrant ssh` to ssh into your vm
  * `blt refresh:local` (from inside of your vm)
  * Enter the site code you want to setup the site for (this can be avoided by adding the site code in blt params like `blt refresh:local mckw`)
  * Access the site in your web browser, e.g.﻿http://local.alshaya-mckw.com/en/user
  * Login using the default credentials:﻿no-reply@acquia.com / admin
  * Perform drush commands from inside of your vm, like drush status -l local.alshaya-mckw.com
  * Login quickly using drush uli -l local.alshaya-mckw.com  (currently doesn't work properly)
* Access site through Varnish in local
  * Comment out the code forcing SSL redirection in `docroot/.htaccess`
  * Access the site on port 81
  * To do any change in VCL do it in `conf/varnish-4.vcl`, do `vagrant ssh` and run `sh box/scripts/configure-varnish.sh`

Next builds can be done using: `blt refresh:local:drupal`
Behat tests can be run using: `vagrant ssh --command='cd /var/www/alshaya ; blt tests:behat'`

### Create a new site

Currently, 2 distinct installation profiles exist in the code base. `transac`
installation profile will enable all the modules required for an a site with
commercial features and integration with Conductor/Magento. `non_transac`
profile is a light/static site without any commercial feature.`

* Create a new theme for your site. See `docroot/themes/custom/README.md` for
more information on how to create a custom theme.
* Create a custom module in `docroot/modules/brands`. This module goal is to
enable the appropriate theme, place the blocks in the theme's regions and
install the specific configuration. See existing brand modules for example.
* Add a new brand support:
  * Add DB and Alias in `box/config.yml`
  * Add site in `blt/alshaya_local_sites.yml` with proper values (check existing sites for example)
  * (For transact site) Add proper settings for the new site in 
    * factory-hooks/environments/magento.php
    * factory-hooks/environments/settings.php
    * factory-hooks/environments/conductor.php
* `vagrant reload --provision`
* Run `blt refresh:local` commands and enter appropriate site code when asked.

### Update local site from cloud.
Script is created to download db from cloud env and configure local env
with that. We also enable stage_file_proxy to ensure files are available
in local as and when required. All required changes are done.
* Configure stage_file_proxy
* Update super admin user
* Enable dblog and other ui modules
* Allows hooking into the script, we can create scripts/install-site-dev.sh
which is already added to .gitignore and add any code we want to execute post
this script (for instance command to shout loud in mac - `say installation 
done`). One argument - site code will be passed to this script.

Script usage:
* `blt local:sync "site" "env" "mode"`
* `blt local:sync mckw dev reuse`
* `blt local:sync mckw dev download`
* `blt local:download "site" "env"`

Be careful in using the mode download, it will take time as it does sql-dump
using drush which can take too much of time.

### Local setup of Behat:
* Start Behat installation on your local by following the steps below:
  * Create a directory, say 'alshaya_behat' [if not exist]
  -  * Clone alshaya git repo
  -  * cd alshaya_behat
  -  * composer install
  -  * npm install --prefix bin chromedriver
  -  * (In a separate terminal window) java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=bin/node_modules/chromedriver/bin/chromedriver -jar vendor/se/selenium-server-standalone/bin/selenium-server-standalone.jar
  -  * bin/behat features/hmkw/manual/basket.feature --profile=(hmuat,hmqa,mckwqa,mckwuat)
    
### How to interpret the Behat reports:
  * When the execution of the feature file is completed, navigate to build directory which is inside your parent directory
  * Open html->behat->index.html. This has your test execution details for the last run only. This gets overwritten with new execution.
  * In order to share the reports, compress the html directory immediately after every run.
