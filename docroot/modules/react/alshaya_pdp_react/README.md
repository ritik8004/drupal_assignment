# Alshaya PDP React

This module provides all the implementations related to PDP layout.

# Update magic-dots.css every-time we update the react-magic-slider-dots library.
The 'react-magic-slider-dots' is a npm package at react/node_modules added via react/package.json. The current version of this library is 1.2.2. If we are updating the react-magic-slider-dots library version we have to replace the 'magic-dots.css' present under 'alshaya_pdp_react/assets/css' folder with the updated one i.e. the one present under "docroot/modules/react/node_modules/react-magic-slider-dots/dist/". Also, we have to update the version mentioned here in readme once we update the current version.
