# Update react-datepicker.css every-time we update the react-datepicker library.
The 'react-datepicker' is a npm package at react/node_modules added via react/package.json. The current version of this library is v2.9.4. If we are updating the react-datepicker library version we have to replace the 'react-datepicker.min.css' present under 'alshaya_spc/assets/css' folder with the updated one i.e. the one present under "docroot/modules/react/node_modules/react-datepicker/dist/". Also, we have to update the version mentioned here in readme once we update the current version.
