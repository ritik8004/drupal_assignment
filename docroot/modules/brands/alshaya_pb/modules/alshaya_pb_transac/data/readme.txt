products_ae_en.data and products_ae_ar.data files are simple copy/paste from
alshaya_mc/data files. Local PotteryBarn is for now connected to the same
Magento than Mothercare. Despite the file names, these are Koweit products.
Despite the directory/brand module location, these are Mothercare products.

products_ae_*.data.real are data files extracted from Pottery Barn MDC. This is
used to test the hard bundle feature so keeping these in the repository for
development/testing purpose only but these won't be picked during local site
installation.
