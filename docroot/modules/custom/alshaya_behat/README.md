## JS Setup

We need JS file to enter data in React inputs (for instance OTP input).

For this we have added the compiled file in js directory, source of which is [here](../../../../architecture/behat/user_events/js/user_events.js)

To update, modify in the architecture directory and compile from there which will output the file [here](js/alshaya_behat_user_event.bundle.js)
