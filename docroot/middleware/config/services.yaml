# This file is the entry point to configure your own services.
# Files in the packages/ subdirectory configure your dependencies.

        # Default ini options for sessions.
        #
        # Some distributions of Linux (most notably Debian) ship their PHP
        # installations with garbage collection (gc) disabled. Since Drupal depends
        # on PHP's garbage collection for clearing sessions, ensure that garbage
        # collection occurs by using the most common settings.
        # @default 1
        gc_probability: 1
        # @default 100
        gc_divisor: 100
        #
        # Set session lifetime (in seconds), i.e. the time from the user's last
        # visit to the active session may be deleted by the session garbage
        # collector. When a session is deleted, authenticated users are logged out,
        # and the contents of the user's $_SESSION variable is discarded.
        # @default 200000
        gc_maxlifetime: 200000
        #
        # Set session cookie lifetime (in seconds), i.e. the time from the session
        # is created to the cookie expires, i.e. when the browser is expected to
        # discard the cookie. The value 0 means "until the browser is closed".
        # @default 2000000
        cookie_lifetime: 2000000
        cookie_secure: true
        cookie_samesite: 'none'
        #
        # Drupal automatically generates a unique session cookie name based on the
        # full domain name used to access the site. This mechanism is sufficient
        # for most use-cases, including multi-site deployments. However, if it is
        # desired that a session can be reused across different subdomains, the
        # cookie domain needs to be set to the shared base domain. Doing so assures
        # that users remain logged in as they cross between various subdomains.
        # To maximize compatibility and normalize the behavior across user agents,
        # the cookie domain should start with a dot.
        #
        # @default none
        # cookie_domain: '.example.com'
