# 2. With options (for drush) -  ./scripts/cron/cron_flock.sh acspm acsf-tools-ml '"acspm" "--types=cart"'
# 3. Without option (for scripts) - ./scripts/cron/cron_flock.sh clear-varnish /var/www/fullpath/clear-varnish.sh
# 4. With option (for scripts) - ./scripts/cron/cron_flock.sh clear-varnish `/var/www/fullpath/clear-varnish.sh arg1 arg2`
