    When fill in billing address with following:
      | spc-area-select-selected-city | {language_billing_city_option} |
      | spc-area-select-selected      | {language_billing_area_option} |
      | address_line1                 | {billing_street}      |
      | dependent_locality            | {billing_building}    |
      | locality                      | {billing_locality}    |
      | address_line2                 | {billing_floor}       |
      | sorting_code                  | {billing_landmark}    |
      | postal_code                   | {billing_postal_code} |
    Then I click jQuery "#address-form-action #save-address" element on page
    And I wait 20 seconds
    And I wait for the page to load
    Then the element "#spc-checkout .spc-main .spc-content div.checkout-link.submit a.checkout-link" should exist
